# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] ESLint warnings addressed
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] All inline styles moved to CSS modules/classes

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env.example` updated with all required variables
- [ ] `.env.local` contains valid IBM Quantum API token
- [ ] Environment variables documented in README
- [ ] Sensitive data excluded from git (check .gitignore)

### 3. Build Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] No build warnings or errors

### 4. IBM Quantum Integration
- [ ] API token is valid and active
- [ ] Connection test passes in the app
- [ ] Backend fetching works correctly
- [ ] Job submission and monitoring functional
- [ ] Fallback simulation works when API unavailable

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Circuit building functionality works
- [ ] Bloch sphere visualization renders correctly
- [ ] Educational content displays properly
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Deployment Platform Setup

### Vercel (Recommended)
- [ ] Repository connected to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables configured:
  - [ ] `IBM_QUANTUM_API_TOKEN`
  - [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (generate new for production)
  - [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` (set to production domain)
- [ ] Build settings verified
- [ ] Domain configured (if custom)

### Other Platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific configuration files created
- [ ] Environment variables set in platform dashboard
- [ ] Build commands configured
- [ ] Output directory specified

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functionality Test
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] IBM Quantum connection test passes
- [ ] Circuit builder works correctly
- [ ] Quantum job submission successful
- [ ] Results visualization displays

### 2. Performance Check
- [ ] Page load times acceptable (< 3 seconds)
- [ ] 3D Bloch sphere renders smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks in animations
- [ ] Mobile performance optimized

### 3. Security Verification
- [ ] API tokens not exposed in client-side code
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] No sensitive data in browser developer tools

### 4. SEO & Accessibility
- [ ] Meta tags configured
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Alt text for images
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Color contrast meets standards

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If deployment issues occur:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Revert to previous working version
   - [ ] Check error logs and monitoring
   - [ ] Verify environment variables

2. **Investigation**
   - [ ] Compare working vs. broken versions
   - [ ] Test locally with production environment
   - [ ] Check IBM Quantum API status

3. **Fix and Redeploy**
   - [ ] Apply fixes to development environment
   - [ ] Test thoroughly before redeployment
   - [ ] Deploy during low-traffic periods

## Monitoring Setup

### 1. Error Tracking
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical errors
- [ ] Monitor IBM API response times

### 2. Analytics
- [ ] Google Analytics or alternative configured
- [ ] Track quantum job submissions
- [ ] Monitor user engagement with educational content

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] API response time monitoring
- [ ] 3D rendering performance metrics

## Documentation

- [ ] README.md updated with deployment instructions
- [ ] API documentation current
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available
- [ ] Contributing guidelines updated

## Notes

- IBM Quantum API has rate limits - monitor usage
- 3D visualizations require WebGL support
- Fallback simulation ensures app works offline
- Educational content can work without IBM integration
